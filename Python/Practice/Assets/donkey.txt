Title: The Wise #####

Once upon a time in a small village nestled between the hills, there lived a humble farmer named Ravi. He had a loyal ##### that had served him well for many years. This ##### was no ordinary #####; it was known for its wisdom and gentle nature.

One day, while Ravi was working in the fields, the ##### wandered off and fell into an old, dry well. Hearing the #####'s distressed brays, Ravi rushed to its side. He tried to pull the ##### out, but it was too heavy. Saddened by the thought of losing his faithful companion, Ravi decided to fill the well with dirt to bury the ##### humanely.

As Ravi and his neighbors started shoveling dirt into the well, the ##### realized what was happening. Instead of panicking, the ##### shook off the dirt from its back and stepped on top of it. With each shovel of dirt, the ##### rose higher and higher. By the time the villagers had nearly filled the well, the ##### simply stepped out, safe and sound.

The villagers were astonished. They realized that what was meant to bury the ##### had actually saved it. The wise ##### had turned a dire situation into an opportunity, teaching everyone an important lesson: when life tries to bury you, shake it off and take a step up.

From that day on, the ##### became a symbol of resilience in the village. Whenever someone faced a tough situation, they would remember the wise ##### and find the strength to rise above their troubles.

And so, the ##### lived happily ever after, respected and loved by all.
